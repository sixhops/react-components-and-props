# react-components-and-props

Now you will build your own React app. You get to choose the content but we will tell you how the components will be organized.

### Requirements

1. Have one main container component (this can be your App)
2. Have two child components which will be rendered side by side in the container (use CSS to achieve this)
3. One of the child components must display data from an object located in the main container (use props)
4. The other child component must display data from an array also located in the main container (use props and the map() function.)

### Setup
Open your terminal and use `create-react-app` to, uhhh, create a new React app. Name the application something appropriate based on the data you choose to display.

```
create-react-app my-amazing-new-app
```

### Suggested Flow
Open up the project directory in your favorite text editor. You can use the generated App component as your container. You will need to:

1. Add two new files for the child components.
2. Create each component to render something basic at first.
3. Export the components from those files and import them into the App file.
4. Test functionality and layout.
5. Setup the object and the array to store the data in your App.
6. Add the necessary HTML (JSX code) to display the data in each child.
7. Test.
